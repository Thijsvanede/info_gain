# info_gain
Implementation of information gain algorithm. There seems to be a debate about how the information gain metric is defined. Whether to use the [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) or the [Mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) as an algorithm to define information gain. This implementation uses the [information gain calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_ratio) as defined by:
